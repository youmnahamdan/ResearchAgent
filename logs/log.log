Traditional fabrication processes often suffer from high variability and defect rates. By integrating machine learning algorithms into real-time monitoring systems, manufacturers can predict and mitigate production anomalies before they impact device performance.\\n\\n1. Introduction:\\nSemiconductor fabrication involves complex multistep processes, including photolithography, etching, and doping. Even minor variations in these stages can significantly affect the final product’s performance and yield. The introduction of AI-based process control systems provides an opportunity to reduce human error and enhance production stability.\\n\\n2. Methodology:\\nThe research utilized a dataset collected from a 300-mm wafer fabrication facility. A supervised learning model was trained to detect pattern anomalies during the lithography step. The AI model was continuously updated using sensor data from temperature, pressure, and chemical flow monitors. Statistical analysis was conducted to compare AI-optimized batches with traditionally controlled ones.\\n\\n3. Results and Discussion:\\nThe implementation of AI-driven monitoring resulted in a 12% improvement in wafer yield and a 9% reduction in defect density. The system demonstrated strong adaptability to different process conditions and maintained stable performance across multiple production cycles. However, challenges remain in model generalization and data security across different fabrication environments.\\n\\n4.
